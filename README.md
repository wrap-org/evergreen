## Who should use Evergreen

Evergreen serves as a resource for:

- WRAP's internal design and development teams
- Partner organizations collaborating on WRAP initiatives
- External suppliers and agencies contributing to WRAP projects
- Anyone building digital experiences within the WRAP ecosystem

## How to get started

Evergreen provides tools for both designers and developers:

- **[Figma Resources](https://www.figma.com/design/yJ6UMIUFdnGkcqwn99oe0d/%F0%9F%8C%B2-Evergreen?node-id=2-2&p=f&t=YNt7unTt6dRbwRy6-0):** Design with our component library, design tokens, and templates to create experiences that align with WRAP's visual identity.

## Website installation

Evergreen is distributed as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wrap.ngo/evergreen?activeTab=readme). The package contains exports for:

- Styles (`@wrap.ngo/evergreen/styles`) CSS to import global Evergreen styles
- Fonts (`@wrap.ngo/evergreen/fonts`) optional CSS to import Evergreen fonts
- Components (`@wrap.ngo/evergreen/components`) JS to register Evergreen components

### No build tools route

Evergreen is packaged to be used directly in the browser, and doesn't require any build.

[Here is a Codepen example](https://codepen.io/Dan-Webb/pen/OPymPKX) which shows how a CDN like esm.sh can be used to load Evergreen.

### Build tools route

First install the NPM package.

```bash
npm install --save @wrap.ngo/evergreen
```

Then, include the global CSS and JS in your main app file.

```js
// Global styles
import '@wrap.ngo/evergreen/styles';
// Optional font import
import '@wrap.ngo/evergreen/fonts';
// Component registration
import '@wrap.ngo/evergreen/components'
```

Use the components anywhere.

```html
<evg-button variant="primary">
  <button type="button">
    Button text
  </button>
</evg-button>
```
