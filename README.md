Evergreen represents our commitment to creating cohesive, accessible, and user-friendly experiences across our entire digital ecosystem.

- **Consistency:** Ensures visual harmony, accessibility compliance, and recognizable brand identity across all touchpoints
- **Clarity:** Provides designers and developers with straightforward guidelines for creating and implementing components
- **Efficiency:** Reduces design and development time through reusable patterns and shared resources
- **Quality:** Maintains high standards as we scale our digital presence and collaborations

## Quick start

Install the module.

```bash
npm install --save @wrap.ngo/evergreen
```

Add the global CSS in your main app file or CSS.

```js
import '@wrap.ngo/evergreen/src/styles/main.scss';

// Optional font face
import '@wrap.ngo/evergreen/src/styles/fonts.scss';
```

Components can be used by importing them into the files to be used or they can be installed once globally (because web components are all registered to a [global registry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry) on the window).

```js
import '@wrap.ngo/evergreen/components/control/Button/Button';
```

Use the component anywhere in HTML or JSX.

```html
<evg-button variant="primary">
  <button type="button">
    Button text
  </button>
</evg-button>
```
