# Migration

## v8 -> v9

The v8 -> v9 jump represents the move from Mobius (the WRAP React Design System) to Evergreen (Web Components). We've taken
this opportunity to include many small optimisations or different ways of doing things due to the framework capabilities
and, as such, this represents a much larger set of breaking changes than would normally be expected.

###Â Tokens
- All tokens have has `--mobius-` replaced with `--evg-`
- `breakpoint.scss` has been replaced with `size.scss`. The structure is slightly different, but the key values remain almost the same.
  - `tablet` -> `lg`
  - `desktop` -> `xl`
  - `max` -> `xxxl`
- Container colours have been removed
- Breakpoint variables have been removed
- Stream has been split out from colours into it's own `--evg-stream-` collection
- State has been split out from colours into it's own `--evg-sentiment-` collection
- The color tokens `body`, `body-muted`, `background`, `background-muted`, `accent`, `link` have been removed in favour of using themes.
- `skin` tokens have been renamed to `theme`
  - emphasis themes have been removed and components now use state directly because components such as alert and badge should not accept all themes and states should not be used on cards and sections.
  - `light` is `default`
  - `dark` is `forest`
- colors `cloud-75`, `white` and `black` have been removed
