# Breakpoints

> Defined viewport widths that trigger responsive layout changes.

Breakpoints establish consistent points at which layouts adapt to different screen sizes.
The system uses a mobile-first approach with clearly defined widths for small, medium, large,
and extra-large devices. These breakpoints ensure that interfaces maintain proper spacing,
readability, and usability across all device types, from smartphones to large desktop displays.
