# Sentiment

> A three-colour system that communicates positive, negative, and neutral states.

Three-colour system (green, red, blue) communicates positive, negative, and neutral states.
These colour tokens are designed with appropriate accessible contrast variations for text,
backgrounds, and borders. This streamlined approach creates clear visual signalling for
users across all interface elements.
