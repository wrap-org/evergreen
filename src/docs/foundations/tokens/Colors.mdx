# Colors

> The color values used throughout the design system.
>

Foundational colours ensure visual consistency and accessibility throughout the design system.
We've organised them into primary, secondary, neutral, and semantic palettes with appropriate
tints and shades. Each colour is defined as a token that can be referenced consistently across
the entire system.
