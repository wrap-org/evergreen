# Button

> Value to control button appearance, including sizes, borders, backgrounds, and states.

Dedicated token collections that standardise button styling across the system. Button tokens
define values for sizes, background and border colours for different states (default, hover,
active, disabled) to ensure consistent interactive elements throughout the interface.
