          <h2>About us</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission is to embed circular living in every boardroom and every
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            WRAP is a global environmental action NGO transforming our broken
            product and food systems to create Circular Living for the benefit
            of climate, nature and people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old approach of ‘take, make, dispose&rsquo; is the major cause
            of inequality, greenhouse gas emissions and mountains of waste,
            polluting our water and destroying biodiversity.  ​
          </p>
          <p>
            Food, textiles and manufactured products account for nearly 50% of
            global greenhouse gas emissions.{' '}
          </p>
          <h3>We offer a new way of doing things.</h3>
          <p>
            By examining sustainability challenges through the lens of
            people&rsquo;s day-to-day lives, we design transformative solutions.
            We call this approach Circular Living.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a non-governmental organisation rooted in technical
            expertise, impartial evidence base and independent convening power.
            For over twenty years, WRAP has delivered programmes to benefit the
            environment — from reducing CO2 emissions and waste to restoring
            nature and enhancing people&rsquo;s lives.
          </p>
          <h3>WRAP is on the side of the doers.</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in achieving impact by bringing people together and
            harnessing the power of businesses, NGOs and governments to create
            the systemic changes that our planet and communities urgently need.

            <li>
              live projects and active partner collaborations all around the
              world from South Africa to Mexico and from Indonesia to the USA.

          <h3>Our impact</h3>
          <h4>Transforming the world&rsquo;s food systems</h4>
          <p>
            We&rsquo;re changing the way food is produced and consumed —
            reducing costs to the environment, to businesses and to people.
          </p>
          <h4>Transforming the world&rsquo;s plastic systems</h4>
          <p>
            We&rsquo;re redesigning the plastics system, across the value chain
            — preventing waste and keeping the material out of the environment.
          </p>
          <h4>Transforming the world&rsquo;s textiles systems</h4>
          <p>
            We&rsquo;re transforming the way that textiles are made, bought and
            used — decreasing emissions, lowering water use and cutting
            pollution.
          </p>
          <h4>Transforming our systems to accelerate the circular economy</h4>
          <p>
            We&rsquo;re leading the world away from a ‘take-make-dispose&rsquo;
            culture to a ‘design-make-reuse&rsquo; approach — radically reducing
            waste and carbon emissions from everyday products.​
