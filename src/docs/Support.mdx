## Support Hours

Support is available inside our standard working hours of 10:00 to 18:00 Monday to Friday.

## Requesting support

You can email [support@etch.co](mailto:support@etch.co) and provide as much information about the issue, to ensure we can meet the response times below.

Alternatively, if you have a code-specific question or problem you can [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/wrap-org/evergreen/issues/new)

## Response times

We classify each request as either “Critical” or “Normal” and respond to each type appropriately:

1. **Critical** – an issue that prevents normal use of a web application. We aim to respond within one working day.
2. **Normal** – an issue that inhibits the core user experience but does not result in a direct loss of revenue. We aim to respond within five working days.

## How we’ll respond

When we respond to your support request, we will do so with one or more of the following:

- A resolution
- A potential workaround
- A request for more information
