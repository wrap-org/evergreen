# Grids, boxes, and cards

This guide covers subdividing content using [grids](?path=/docs/components-composition-grid--docs), 
[boxes](?path=/docs/components-canvas-box--docs) and [cards](?path=/docs/components-canvas-card--docs).
It assumes the components have [been installed](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs), the 
[page is set up](?path=/docs/guides-page-setup--docs) and the basic structure has been 
put in place using some [sections and wrappers](?path=/docs/guides-page-sections-and-wrappers--docs).

## Grids 

<Markdown>{GridStories.default.parameters.docs.description.component}</Markdown>

<Canvas
  of={GridStories.Grid}
/>

The grid can be used to structure any grouped content, such as text, images, cards, and boxes. A 
general rule of thumb is, if 2 components or groups of content need to be next to each other, use 
the grid.
