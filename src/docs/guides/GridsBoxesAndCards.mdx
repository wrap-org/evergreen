# Grids, boxes, and cards

This guide covers subdividing content using [grids](?path=/docs/components-composition-grid--docs),
[boxes](?path=/docs/components-canvas-box--docs) and [cards](?path=/docs/components-canvas-card--docs).
It assumes the components have [been installed](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs), the
[page is set up](?path=/docs/guides-page-setup--docs) and the basic structure has been
put in place using some [sections and wrappers](?path=/docs/guides-page-sections-and-wrappers--docs).

## Grids

<Markdown>{GridStories.default.parameters.docs.description.component}</Markdown>

<Canvas
  of={GridStories.Grid}
/>

The grid can be used to structure any grouped content, such as text, images, cards, and boxes. A
general rule of thumb is, if 2 components or groups of content need to be next to each other, use
the grid.

<Canvas
  of={GridRecipes.Quad}
/>

<Canvas
  of={GridRecipes.ImagePairs}
/>

<Canvas
  of={CardRecipes.Row}
/>

## Boxes

<Markdown>{BoxStories.default.parameters.docs.description.component}</Markdown>

<Canvas
  of={BoxStories.Box}
/>

<Canvas
  of={BoxStories.BoxSection}
/>

## Cards

<Markdown>{CardStories.default.parameters.docs.description.component}</Markdown>

<Canvas
  of={CardStories.Clickable}

<Canvas
  of={CardStories.Layouts}
