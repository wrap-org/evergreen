# Page setup

This guide covers setting up a brand new page from scratch using the Evergreen Design System.
It assumes [the system has been installed](?path=/docs/getting-started--docs) and the components
are ready to use on a page.

## Skip to content

<Markdown>{SkipLinkStories.default.parameters.docs.description.component}</Markdown>

<Canvas
  of={SkipLinkStories.SkipLink}
/>

## App wrapper

<Markdown>{AppStories.default.parameters.docs.description.component}</Markdown>

<Canvas
  of={AppStories.App}
/>

## Site header

<Markdown>{HeaderStories.default.parameters.docs.description.component}</Markdown>

<docs-fullscreen-story>
  <Canvas
    of={HeaderRecipes.Light}
  />
</docs-fullscreen-story>

<docs-fullscreen-story>
  <Canvas
    of={HeaderRecipes.Dark}
  />
</docs-fullscreen-story>

<docs-fullscreen-story>
  <Canvas
    of={HeaderRecipes.Compact}
  />
</docs-fullscreen-story>

## Site footer

The [site footer](?path=/story/recipes-footer--full) sits at the bottom of the page and is passed
into the `footer` slot of the [app wrapper](?path=/docs/components-composition-app--docs) component,
which keeps it at the bottom of the page.

There is currently no dedicated footer component, preferring instead to use generic
[page sections(?path=/docs/components-canvas-section--docs) (one of which uses a special coal theme
just for the footer).

This means the footer is extremely flexible and can be adapted to the current apps needs, such as
displaying a large, fully featured, footer in brochureware sites or something more minimal in an app
context (or even none at all).

<docs-fullscreen-story>
  <Canvas
    of={FooterRecipes.Full}
  />
</docs-fullscreen-story>

<docs-fullscreen-story>
  <Canvas
    of={FooterRecipes.Minimal}
  />
</docs-fullscreen-story>

## Main content

Once the app wrapper, header, and footer have been put in place, we can move on to the main content
which begins with [page sections and wrappers](?path=/docs/guides-page-sections-and-wrappers--docs).
