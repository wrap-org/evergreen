# Evergreen example

This is a basic working code example to demonstrate a minimal Evergreen setup.

Vite is used for a dev server and to serve the assets at the website root.

To match this setup on a new directory you can:

1. Copy `package.json`, `index.html`, `vite.config.js` and `main.ts`
2. Install the dependencies `npm install`
3. Start the dev server `npm start`
